This repo contains my implementation to several algorithms for part of sentiment analysis, trained and tested on the Sentiment Treebank dataset by 
Stanford. It contains implementation of s simlple log-linear model, a word-2-vec linear model, and a LSTM model. 
It was written as an assignment in the "Natural Language Processing" course in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Fall semester of 2021.
